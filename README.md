# bank_loan_case_study

In this project I was working as a data analyst at a finance 
company that specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers. 
My company faces a challenge: some customers who don't have a sufficient 
credit history take advantage of this and default on their loans. My task is to 
use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to analyze patterns in the data and ensure 
that capable applicants are not rejected.

The main aim of this project is to identify patterns that indicate if a customer 
will have difficulty paying their installments. This information can be used to 
make decisions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, or 
lending at a higher interest rate to risky applicants. The company wants to 
understand the key factors behind loan default so it can make better decisions 
about loan approval.

1. Identify Missing Data and Deal with it Appropriately: As a data analyst, 
you come across missing data in the loan application dataset. It is 
essential to handle missing data effectively to ensure the accuracy of the 
analysis.
My Task: Identify the missing data in the dataset and decide on an 
appropriate method to deal with it using Excel built-in functions and 
features.

2. Identify Outliers in the Dataset: Outliers can significantly impact the 
analysis and distort the results. You need to identify outliers in the loan 
application dataset.
My Task: Detect and identify outliers in the dataset using Excel statistical 
functions and features, focusing on numerical variables.

3. Analyze Data Imbalance: Data imbalance can affect the accuracy of the 
analysis, especially for binary classification problems. Understanding the 
data distribution is crucial for building reliable models.
My Task: Determine if there is data imbalance in the loan application 
dataset and calculate the ratio of data imbalance using Excel functions.

4. Perform Univariate, Segmented Univariate, and Bivariate Analysis: To 
gain insights into the driving factors of loan default, it is important to 
conduct various analyses on consumer and loan attributes.
My Task: Perform univariate analysis to understand the distribution of 
individual variables, segmented univariate analysis to compare variable 
distributions for different scenarios, and bivariate analysis to explore 
relationships between variables and the target variable using Excel 
functions and features.

5. Identify Top Correlations for Different Scenarios: Understanding the 
correlation between variables and the target variable can provide 
insights into strong indicators of loan default.
My Task: Segment the dataset based on different scenarios (e.g., clients 
with payment difficulties and all other cases) and identify the top 
correlations for each segmented data using Excel functions.
